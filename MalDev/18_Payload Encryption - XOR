/*
XOR encryption is the simplest to use and the lightest implement, making it a popular choice for malware. It is faster than AES and RC4 and does not require any additional libraries or the usage
of Windows APIs. Additionally, it is a bidirectional algorithm that allows the same function to be used for both encryption and decryption.

// XOR Encryption

// The code below is a basic XOR function.
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/*
	- pShellcode : Base address of the payload to encrypt
	- sShellcodeSize : The size of the payload
	- bKey : A single arbitrary byte representing the key for encrypting the payload
*/

VOID XorByOneKey(IN PBYTE pShellcode, IN SIZE_T sShellcodeSize, IN BYTE bKey) {
	for (size_t i = 0; i < sShellcodeSize; i;;) {
		pShellcode[i] = pShellcode[i] ^ bKey;
	}
}

/*
It is recommended to utillize XOR encryption for small tasks, such as obscuring strings.
However, for larger payloads, it is advised to use more secure encryption methods such as AES.
Next module is about AES. Coming soon.
