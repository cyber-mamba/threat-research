// 19_Payload Encryption - AES Encryption

/*
Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is more secure encryption algorithm.
It is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Regardledss of the chosen AES type, AES always requires a 128-bit input and produces a 128-bit 
output blocks. The important thing to keep in mind is that the input data should be multiples 
of 16 bytes(128 bits).
If the payload being encrypted is not a multiple of 16 bytes then padding is required to increase the
size of the payload and make it a multiple of 16 bytes.

In this module provides 2 code  samples that user AES256-CBC. The first sample is achieved
through the bCrypt library which utilizes WinAPIs and the second sample uses Tiny Aes Project.

Note that since the AES256-CBC is being used, the code uses a 32-byte key and a 16-byte IV.
