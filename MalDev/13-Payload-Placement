/*
13 Payload Placement - .data & .rdata Sections

As a malware developer, one will have several options as to where the payload can be stored within the PE file.
Payloads can be stored in one of the floowing PE sections.

	.data
	.rdata
	.text
	.rsrc

The .data section of a PE file is a section of a program&s executable file that contains initialized global and static variables.
This section is readable and writable, ir suitable for an encrypted payload that requires decryption during runtime.
If the payload is a global or local variable, it will be stored in the .datasection.

The code snippet below shows an example of having a payload stored in the .data section.

If program data is in to .data section, it is maybe initialized global variable or static variable.
If data is in to .rdata, it is maybe const variable. We can't write or execute. It is just redable.
