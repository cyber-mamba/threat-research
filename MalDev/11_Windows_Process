11.Windows Process


Process Environment Block (PEB)
PEB is a data structure in WIndows that contains information about a process such as its parameters, startup information, allocated heap information, and loaded DLLs, in addition to others.
PEB also stores information about the process such as the process ID (PID) and the path to the executable.
Every process created has its own PEB data structure, that will contain its own set of information about it.

/*
Being Debugged

Being Debugged is a flag in the PEB structure that indicates whether the process is being debugged or not.
It is set to 1 (TRUE) when the process is being debugged and 0 (FALSE) when it is not.
It is used by the Windows loader to determin whether to launch the application with a debugger attached or not.
